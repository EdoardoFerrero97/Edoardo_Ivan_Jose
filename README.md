# IMPACT_PROJECT_2023

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download the file .ipynb and open it in Collab.
2. Download the file TG-A.xlsx
3. In the file_path in the Collab code change the URL of the excel file location. Here an example:
                file_path = ‘Drive/MyDrive/Impact Project 2023/TG-A-Ejemplo1.xlsx’
4. Now you should be able to run the whole code without any issue.

ESELEC - GENERATOR MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTICS

This report discusses the significant challenges posed by short-circuits within the rotor
winding of synchronous generators in the electrical sector.
Such short-circuits are a major concern for organiza=ons like Eselec, a experienced electrical

engineering and consultancy firm.and are frequently caused by the deteriora=on of non-
conductor materials brought on by aging and various thermal and mechanical stress

condi=ons.
These flaws result in an increase in excita=on current, mechanical vibra=ons, rotor damage,
and magne=c field imbalance, all of which can result in significant opera=onal interrup=ons
such as generator shut-downs, produc=on losses, and the requirement for immediate
maintenance. Commercial monitoring systems currently available are frequently pricey and
primarily intended for high-power genera=ng units, making them imprac=cal for smaller
generators that are frequently used across a variety of industrial sectors.
[The report emphasizes the demand for a scalable, affordable method of rotor winding
monitoring and generator output maximiza=on.
We can create a predic=ve maintenance system to iden=fy and stop poten=al generator
failures in real =me by u=lizing ar=ficial intelligence (AI) techniques and data analy=cs.
In the report sugges=ons include the necessity of clean, high-quality data for machine learning
model training and applica=on. The report also describes the Machine Learning (ML) project
lifecycle, which includes using Docker for deployment, Flask to build a REST API, and AWS to
deploy the model.
Then, a mechanism for data collec=on will be set up to compile crucial opera=onal data, which
will then be cleaned up and normalized for the machine learning model. The model will then
be deployed into a environment aSer being trained and validated with historical data. It will
take in real-=me data from the sensors, process it, and produce forecasts for upcoming
equipment breakdowns.
The report ends by highligh=ng the successful use of a combina=on of supervised and
unsupervised machine learning models for the dataset TG-A-Ejemplo1 using strategy 04:
Isola=on Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
This tac=c aims to foresee the next maintenance the machine will require in order to avoid
unplanned shutdowns and cut costs.
In conclusion, we emphasize the importance of these aspects in a machine learning project
and show that the success of such a predic=ve maintenance system heavily depends on the
quality and clarity of the input data, clear feature defini=ons, and rigorous data preprocessing.

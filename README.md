The short-circuit detection model for rotor winding in synchronous generators is an advanced system that utilizes machine learning, sensor data analysis, and predictive analytics. By monitoring parameters like voltage, current, temperature, and vibrations, it identifies abnormal behavior indicating a short-circuit. Through real-time data analysis and comparison with historical patterns, it detects anomalies and generates timely alerts. The model maintains a comprehensive database of fault signatures and rotor winding characteristics for accurate differentiation. It provides information about fault location, severity, and recommendations for corrective actions. This model improves reliability, safety, and operational efficiency, minimizing downtime and repair costs, while ensuring uninterrupted electricity supply in the electrical sector.
